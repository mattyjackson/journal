hello world it is beautiful weather outside today. I just felt super productive because I uploaded another git file all by myself. I am making progress in this super confusing compututing world. 

Something I learned today is that if I am in my terminal and want to get to a destionation quickly..all i have to do is type 
cd and then drag the folder there... it will directly type that out for you. If your folder has a space in it... it might help to put it in quote marks. I am calling this the drag and drop 

control A moves ur cursor to the front of what ur typing and control E brings you to the end... option hold down will let you cursor to the spot
